= Backwards Compatibility

* RodaResponse#set_cookie and #delete_cookie have been removed.

* Roda.request_module and .response_module have been removed.

* Roda.hash_matcher has been removed.

* The :extension hash matcher has been removed.

* The :param and :param! hash matchers have been removed.

* RodaRequest#full_path_info has been removed.

* The :opts render plugin option is no longer respected, Use the
  :template_opts option instead.

* Plugin option hashes for the chunked, default_headers,
  error_email, and render plugins are now frozen.

* The :header hash matcher in the header_matchers plugin now
  yields the header value to the block.

* Roda.json_result_classes in the json plugin is now frozen.

* The PATH_INFO and SCRIPT_NAME env variables are no longer modified
  during routing.

* Roda#initialize now takes an env hash, and #call now takes the
  route block.  The private #_route method has been removed.
  
* RodaRequest#keep_remaining_path/#updating_remaining_path private
  methods have been removed.

* The render plugin's :layout option is now always set to true or
  false, specifying whether a layout should be used by default.
  The template used for a layout is now located as the :template
  option inside :layout_opts.

= New Plugins

* A padrino_render plugin has been added, which adds render/partial
  methods that work similarly to Padrino's.

= Other New Features

* A Roda#render_template private method has been added to the render
  plugin.  All internal users of render should switch to calling
  render_template.

* The halt plugin now integrates with the symbol_views and json
  plugins, allowing things like:

    r.halt(:template)
    r.halt('key'=>'value')

= Other Improvements

* The error_handler plugin now rescues ScriptError in addition to
  StandardError.  This handles SyntaxError (raised by ERB),
  LoadError (raised by require), and NotImplementedError (raised
  by TSort).

* Using a :layout=>true option to the render plugin's view method
  now uses the default layout template, instead of a template named
  'true'.  It can be used to force a layout even if the render
  plugin has been configured to not use a layout by default.

* Roda apps that use the middleware plugin can now be used as regular
  rack apps.  Previously, using the middleware plugin made it
  impossible to use the app as a regular rack app.

* Roda#request and #response are now faster.

* Roda avoids creating unnecessary hashes in more places now.
