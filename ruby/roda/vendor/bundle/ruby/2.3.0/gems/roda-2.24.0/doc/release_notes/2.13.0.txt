= New Features

* The render plugin now supports :check_paths and :allowed_paths
  options.  Setting :check_paths to true will turn on path checking of
  template files.  By default, template files are required to be in
  the :views directory, otherwise an exception will be raised.  Using
  the :check_paths option can prevent security issues when template
  names are derived from user input.  The :allowed_paths option
  overrides which path prefixes are allowed. In Roda 3, :check_paths
  will default to true.
