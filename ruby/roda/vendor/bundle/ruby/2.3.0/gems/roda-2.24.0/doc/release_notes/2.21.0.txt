= New Features

* The streaming plugin now supports a handle_stream_error method to
  handle exceptions when using stream(:loop=>true).  This method
  takes the exception and the stream object, and can be used to log
  errors, output errors into the stream, close the stream, ignore
  errors, or any other error handling.

= Other Improvements

* A couple of unused variable assignments have been removed, providing
  a minor speedup.

* The specs no longer produce deprecation warnings when using Minitest
  5.10.

* Some verbose warnings have been removed from the specs.
