= New Features

* A symbol_status plugin has been added for using symbolic status names
  in response.status=:

    class App < Roda
      plugin :symbol_status

      route do |r|
        r.is "needs_authorization"
          response.status = :unauthorized
        end
      end

= Other Improvements

* The middleware plugin will now also run the application's middleware
  when the application is used as middleware.  For example, if you
  have the following code in your config.ru file:

    class App < Roda
      plugin :csrf
      plugin :middleware
      route{}
    end

    use App
  
  previously, the csrf protection would not be enforced, as it uses a
  middleware instead of being part of the application. Now, csrf
  protection will be enforced.  This change makes it so the Roda
  application operates the same way regardless of whether it is run
  as the rack application or used as rack middleware.

  Because of this change, if you are nesting roda applications using
  the middleware plugin, you may need to use the middleware plugin's
  :env_var option to specify the environment variable used to
  indicate to the Roda application that it is being run as middleware.

= Backwards Compatibility

* See above changes to the middleware plugin if you are using
  middleware inside a Roda application that uses the middleware
  plugin.
