= New Features

* An :explicit_cache option has been added to the render plugin.
  This is similar to the :cache=>false option, but instead of
  disabling caching completely, this disables caching by default but
  allows for explicit caching of templates by providing the :cache
  option to view/render.

  In development mode, Roda now defaults to :explicit_cache=>true
  instead of :cache=>false.

* An :inherit_cache option has been added to the render plugin,
  making subclasses of that class start with a dup of the template
  cache, instead of starting with an empty template cache.  This can
  result in less memory used.

* Roda#error_email in the error_email plugin now accepts non-Exception
  arguments (such as strings).  This can be useful in conditions that
  are errors you may want to notify about, where an exception hasn't
  been raised.

* Roda#error_email_content has been added to the error_email plugin.
  This can be used to create the email message, which can be delivered
  via another mechanism, and may make testing easier.

= Other Improvements

* Roda.freeze in the static_routing plugin now returns self, fixing
  code such as Roda.freeze.app.
