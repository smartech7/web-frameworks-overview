= New Features

* The json plugin now accepts a :content_type option, which will
  override the default Content-Type response header used for
  responses.

* Stream#write has been added to the streaming plugin, allowing
  the following type of code to work:

    stream do |out|
      IO.copy_stream(StringIO.new(content), out)
    end

= Other Improvements

* Roda now works with ruby 2.3's --enable-frozen-string-literal,
  and all of the library files are set to use frozen string
  literals by default.

  Most of roda's plugin-specific dependencies were found to have
  issues with frozen string literals, and while pull requests have
  been sent to fix the issues, it's unlikely that you would
  currently be able to use --enable-frozen-string-literal in
  production.

* The json plugin will no longer override a Content-Type header if
  one is already set.
