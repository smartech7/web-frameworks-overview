= New Features

* The assets plugin now supports a :compiled_asset_host option, which
  specifies a hostname used to serve compiled assets.

* The render plugin now supports a :cache_class option, which
  specificies a class to use for the thread-safe template cache.
  This can be used to setup LRU caching or caching that checks
  modify times on the underlying template files.

* r.multi_run in the multi_run plugin now accepts a block, and calls
  the block before dispatching to the related rack application.  This
  can be used to modify the environment before dispatching.  Example:

    r.multi_run do |prefix|
      env['authenticated'] = true
    end

= Backwards Compatibility

* The :by_name option to the path plugin now defaults to true in
  development mode.  This should only negatively affect applications
  that register anonymous classes with the path plugin.
