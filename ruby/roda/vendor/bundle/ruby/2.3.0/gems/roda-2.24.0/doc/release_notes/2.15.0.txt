= New Features

* A public plugin has been added.  This adds an r.public method
  for serving all files in the public directory.  The public
  plugin can replace usage of the static plugin, and is more
  flexible.  You can place r.public at any point in the routing
  tree, and it will use the remaining path to lookup the file
  in the public directory.  You can also pass the :gzip option
  when loading the plugin, and it will serve already gzipped
  files to the client if the client supports gzipped transfer
  encoding and the file exists with a .gz extension.  Example:

    plugin :public
    route do |r|
      # Serve public files before routing
      r.public

      # ...
    end

* The :header matcher added by the header_matchers plugin now
  automatically prefixes the key with HTTP_ when looking it up in
  the environment, if the :header_matcher_prefix application
  option is set.  This behavior will probably be the default in
  Roda 3.

    # Before
    r.on :header => 'http_accept'

    # Now, with :header_matcher_prefix=>true application option
    r.on :header => 'accept'

* The content_for plugin now accepts an :append=>true option to
  support appending to the existing content instead of overwriting
  the existing content if called multiple times.  This behavior
  will probably be the default in Roda 3.

    # Before
    content_for(:form, 'a')
    content_for(:form, 'b')
    content_for(:form) # => 'b'

    # Now, with :append=>true option
    content_for(:form, 'a')
    content_for(:form, 'b')
    content_for(:form) # => 'ab'

= Other Improvements

* The r.send_file method in the sinatra_helpers plugin now works
  correctly when using rack 2.

* The specs now run correctly on Windows.
