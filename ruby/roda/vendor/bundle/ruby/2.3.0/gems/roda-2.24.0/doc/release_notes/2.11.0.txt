= New Features

* A params_capturing plugin has been added, which makes string and
  symbol matchers update the request params with the value of the
  captured segments, using the matcher as the key:
  
    plugin :params_capturing
 
    route do |r|
      # GET /foo/123/abc/67
      r.on("foo/:bar/:baz", :quux) do
        r[:bar] #=> '123'
        r[:baz] #=> 'abc'
        r[:quux] #=> '67'
      end
    end
  
  Note that this updating of the request params using the matcher as
  the key is only done if all arguments to the matcher are symbols
  or strings.
  
  All matchers will update the request params by adding all
  captured segments to the captures key, including
  symbol and string matchers:
 
    r.on(:x, /(\d+)\/(\w+)/, ':y') do
      r[:x] #=> nil
      r[:y] #=> nil
      r[:captures] #=> ["foo", "123", "abc", "67"]
    end
  
  Note that the request params captures entry will be appended to with
  each nested match:
 
    r.on(:w) do
      r.on(:x) do
        r.on(:y) do
          r.on(:z) do
            r[:captures] # => ["foo", "123", "abc", "67"]
          end
        end
      end
    end
 
  Note that any existing params captures entry will be overwritten
  by this plugin.  You can use r.GET or r.POST to get the underlying
  entry, depending on how it was submitted.
  
  Also note that the param keys are actually stored in r.params as
  strings and not symbols (r[] converts the argument to a string
  before looking it up in r.params).
 
  Also note that this plugin will not work correctly if you are using
  the symbol_matchers plugin with custom symbol matching and are using
  symbols that capture multiple values or no values.

* A :scope option is now supported by render/view in the render plugin,
  which allows you to specify the object in which context to evaluate
  the template.

= Other Improvements

* The assets plugin's support for the Minjs javascript minifier now
  supports the latest version (0.4.1).

= Backwards Compatibility

* Support for Minjs <0.4.0 has been dropped from the assets plugin.
  Please upgrade Minjs at the same time you upgrade Roda if you are
  using both of them.
