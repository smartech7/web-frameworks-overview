= New Features

* The middleware plugin now accepts a block that can be used to
  implement configurable middleware.  This allows you to load the
  Roda application as middleware in another application, and provide
  options/block that are passed to the block you passed when loading
  the middleware plugin.  Example:

    class Mid < Roda
      plugin :middleware do |middleware, *args, &block|
        middleware.opts[:middleware_args] = args
        block.call(middleware)
      end
    end

    class App < Roda
      use Mid, :foo, :bar do |middleware|
        middleware.opts[:middleware_args] << :baz
      end
    end

  Note that when passing a block when loading the middleware plugin,
  using the middleware in another rack application will actually
  load a subclass of the middleware (Mid in the example above).
  This allows you to use the Roda middleware multiple times in the
  same process with different configurations.

* The cookies plugin now accepts options that are used as the default
  options when setting and deleting cookies:

    plugin :cookies, :path => '/foo', :domain => 'example.com'

* A strip_path_prefix plugin has been added, which can be used to
  strip prefixes from internal paths.  Internally Sequel stores
  most paths as absolute paths, but there are cases where this
  doesn't work well, such as symlink changes and chroot.  This
  plugin supports those scenarios.

* A disallow_file_uploads plugin has been added, which raises
  an exception if the user attempts a multipart file upload.
  More exactly, it makes the application raise an exception if
  attempting to parse a request body when the user has submitted
  a multipart file upload.  This is useful if you don't need to
  support file uploads in your application, or cases where no
  paths are writable by the application (due to chroot or system call
  filtering).

* The :freeze_middleware option has been added, which freezes all
  middleware instances when building the rack application.  This
  can help find thread safety issues in middleware.

= Other Improvements

* The h plugin is now about 6x faster on ruby 2.3+ due to the use
  of cgi/escape.

* The static_routing plugin now works with the hooks plugin if the
  hooks plugin is loaded first.

* The render plugin's render cache is no longer cleared when loading
  the plugin multiple times.

= Backwards Compatibility

* The h plugin now escapes ' as &#39; instead of &#x27;.
