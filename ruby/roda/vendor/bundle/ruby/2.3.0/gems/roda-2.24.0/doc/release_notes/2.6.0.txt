= New Features

* :params and :params! matchers have been added to the param_matchers
  plugin, allowing you to match multiple params at the same time:

    r.on :params=>%w'foo bar' do |foo, bar| end
    # instead of
    r.on({:param=>'foo'}, :param=>'bar') do |foo, bar| end

= Other Improvements

* When loading the csrf plugin multiple times, instead of loading the
  middleware multiple times with different settings, merge options
  in later plugin calls into a single middleware option hash, and
  only load the middleware once.

  This allows plugins to depend on the csrf plugin, while also
  allowing the application to use the csrf plugin with options.

* request.halt now works correctly when used inside a before hook when
  using the hooks plugin.
